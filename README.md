This repository contains the code of Design-Aware Integration of Single Cell ExpEriments (DAISEE), a tool for analysis of perturbation effects from single-cell data.


DAISEE is appropriate for datasets with single-cell perturbation experiments with complex experimental designs where data for several conditions were collected over several independent batches. 


DAISEE extends LIGER (https://github.com/welch-lab/pyliger), a previously available computational method for single-cell data integration and perturbation analysis, and more efficiently separates perturbation effects from confounding variation. 
DAISEE methods are available here, as well as notebooks containing benchmarking experiments on simulated and previously available data.
